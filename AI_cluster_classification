% Matlab's Self-Organizing Map (SOMs) Neural Network
%
% The input data file needs to have columns which represent a set of things (i.e classes of patients: controls and disease,etc )
% and rows that represent the attributes of those things (i.e., miRNAs, drug concentrations, molecular composition, etc)

% Step 1: Import dataset without headers/labels, select numerical matrix and name it: x
% Step 2: Copy the code below and paste it into the matlab command line.

net = selforgmap([1 2]);
view(net)
[net,tr] = train(net,x);
y = net(x);
cluster_index = vec2ind(y);
plotsomhits(net,x)

% Step 3: Open the cluster_index variable and copy paste it into an Excel spreadsheet, 
%         make sure that the values are pasted under the column labels of your dataset in Excel.
%
% id             ctrl1 ctrl2 ctrl3 ctrl4 ctrl5 tumor1 tumor2 tumor3 tumor4 tumor5
% cluster_index    1     2     1     1     1     2      2     1       2      1
% mir-123          23    24   24    12    23    33     36    24      32     31
% mire-456         22    23   25    22    24    32     33    21      30     30
%
%
% Step 4: Select the cluster_index values under the control labels, copy and transpose paste them into a new spreadsheet
%         and sort the column smallest to greatest. Do this seperately for the disease labels.
% 
% 1
% 1
% 1
% 1 
% 2
% 
% Step 5: Count the frequency of 1 and 2, etc. Create a contingency table and paste in the frequency of values for each class.
%
%  Class   Disease   Control
%     1       2         4
%     2       3         1
%
%
% Step 6: Use Fishers Exact test to test the contingency table to see if there is a significant non-random association.
%

dataTBL = table([2;3],[4;1],'VariableNames',{'Disease','Control'},'RowNames',{'Class1','Class2'})

% Step 7: Use a right-tailed Fisher's exact test to determine if the odds of being diseased is higher for individuals 
% who were in class 1 than for individuals who were in class 2. Conduct the test at the 5% significance level.

[h,p,stats] = fishertest(dataTBL,'Tail','right','Alpha',0.05)
